# ProjectileMotion
Projectile motion problem with air drag (initial value problem of differential equation).

You have entered a “throw a cricket ball as far as you can” competition. The ball ways 160 g, and will experience a drag force Dv 2 . Take D=1 g/m. You can release the ball at a height of 1.8 m from the ground with a velocity of 120 km/hr. 

How far will the ball go if you release it at 45 deg. to the horizontal? 

At what angle should you release the ball so that it goes the farthest? 

Illustrate the dependence of the trajectory on the angle of release in a plot.
